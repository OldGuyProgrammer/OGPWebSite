# Old Guy Programmer Public Web Site

Open Source program used to elicit comments and corrections from the programming community.

This is the client side app to introduce the Old Guy Programmer company to the world written as an excercise in creating an API and a Client App. The API is called OGPEmailer and is also open for examination.

Menu items on the landing page will show the user a short "About" page, a page where the user can send us a message, and a Portfolio page. The Portfolio will contain links to other web pages we've written. At this time, there is only one page called "Airport Info."

The application is written using frameworks like React, HTML, Sass and Javascript. It is my first attempt as a public facing app and I welcome comments.

Many thanks to UDEMY.COM and the people who created the classes were I learned these skills: Dr Angela Yu, Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang, and Jonas Schmedtman.
