# Old Guy Programmer Public Web Site

Open Source program used to elicit comments and corrections from the programming community.

This is the client side app to introduce the Old Guy Programmer company to the world written as an excercise in creating an API and a Client App. The API is called OGPEmailer and is also open for examination.

Menu items on the landing page will show the user a short "About" page, a page where the user can send us a message, and a Portfolio page. The Portfolio will contain links to other web pages we've written. At this time, there is only one page called "Airport Info."

The application is written using frameworks like React, HTML, Sass and Javascript. It is my first attempt as a public facing app and I welcome comments.

>A help feature is built into all OGP programs. Hovering over a control (button, link, live text) will cause help text to be displayed.

Many thanks to UDEMY.COM and the people who created the classes were I learned these skills: Dr Angela Yu, Andrei Neagoie and Yihua Zhang, and Jonas Schmedtman.

## Portfolio

The Portfolio menu item exposes works done by the Old Guy Programmer team so that propective clients can see what types of work were done. As of this writing these works are ready:

- Airport Information

### Airport Information

**Airport Info** shows runway and readio frequency information for the specified airport.

> When **Airport Info** is first invoked, the user is invited to enter a standard **IATA or ICAO** code, then tap **Get info**. The user needs tp type in the country letter because no country is asssumed by the program. For example, to display information about Chicago O'hare airport, type **KORD**, for London Heathrow, type **EGLL**.

> If the user types in an invalid airport code, an error box is displayed. The user can then dismiss the error box and try again.

> Tapping the browser **Back Arrow** will return to an OGP screen.
